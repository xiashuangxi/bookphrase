## Introduction
There are many applications of the Internet that require the creation
   and management of a session, where a session is considered an
   exchange of data between an association of participants.  The
   implementation of these applications is complicated by the practices
   of participants: users may move between endpoints, they may be
   addressable by multiple names, and they may communicate in several
   different media - sometimes simultaneously.  Numerous protocols have
   been authored that carry various forms of real-time multimedia
   session data such as voice, video, or text messages.  The Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) works in concert with these protocols by

Overview of SIP Functionality

   SIP is an application-layer control protocol that can establish,
   modify, and terminate multimedia sessions (conferences) such as
   Internet telephony calls.  SIP can also invite participants to
   already existing sessions, such as multicast conferences.  Media can
   be added to (and removed from) an existing session.  SIP
   transparently supports name mapping and redirection services, which
   supports personal mobility [27] - users can maintain a single
   externally visible identifier regardless of their network location.

   SIP supports five facets of establishing and terminating multimedia
   communications:

      User location: determination of the end system to be used for
           communication;

      User availability: determination of the willingness of the called
           party to engage in communications;

      User capabilities: determination of the media and media parameters
           to be used;

      Session setup: "ringing", establishment of session parameters at
           both called and calling party;

      Session management: including transfer and termination of
           sessions, modifying session parameters, and invoking
           services.
